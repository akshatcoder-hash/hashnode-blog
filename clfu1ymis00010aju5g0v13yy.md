If you're looking to deploy a smart contract on any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain, you may have encountered some roadblocks. With different chains having their own unique quirks, it can be challenging to navigate the process of deployment.

Fortunately, there's a solution: thirdweb. With thirdweb, you can deploy your smart contract on any EVM chain without the hassle of dealing with chain-specific idiosyncrasies.

Here's how it works: thirdweb is a tool that abstracts away the complexities of EVM chains, providing a unified interface that simplifies the deployment process. You can use thirdweb to deploy your smart contract on chains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon with just a few simple commands.

In this blog, we'll walk you through the steps of deploying a smart contract on any EVM chain using thirdweb. Whether you're new to smart contract development or an experienced developer, we'll provide you with the information you need to get started.

## Setting up your Development Environment

Let's examine how to build a smart contract from the ground up using the thirdweb framework and then deploy it to any blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Enter the following command in your terminal while in the desired directory where you want to start the project:

```bash
npx thirdweb create contract
```

A verbose message from the thirdweb framework will appear on your terminal prompt after running the aforementioned command. You will be asked to enter a name for your project in the message. Please enter your choice of name. ThirdWeb-demo will be used in this example.

Now, choose the framework you want to use to create contracts. We will go with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

Let's name this contract as 'MyContract'

## Writing the Smart Contract

**Let me give a quick walkthrough of the contract:**

This is a simple smart contract written in Solidity. The contract is named "MyContract" and it contains a private unsigned integer variable called "value". The variable is private, which means it can only be accessed within the contract itself and not by external entities.

The contract also contains two functions: "store" and "retrieve".

The "store" function takes a uint256 argument "\_value" and sets the value of "value" to the input argument. Additionally, it emits an event "ValueChanged" with the input argument as a parameter, which can be used to track and log changes to the value.

The "retrieve" function returns the current value of "value" when called. It is marked as "view" which means that it does not modify the state of the contract, and can be called without incurring any gas cost.

The contract also includes a SPDX license identifier, which is a standardized way to indicate the license that the contract is released under. In this case, it is licensed under the MIT license.

Finally, the contract specifies the Solidity version to use, which is 0.8.17 in this case. This means that the contract can be compiled using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.17 or a higher version.

## Deploying the contract ðŸš€

In the same directory, run

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

1...2...3...  
Deployed!

Your code is now compiled and deployed to IPFS.

Now, you will come across a Dashboard to choose the selected network

To deploy the contract, you must have some faucet in your Testnet wallet.

Select any of the networks you want to deploy on. In this case, we are going with Optimism Goerli Testnet.

Your smart contract will start to be deployed as soon as you click the "Deploy Now" button. Your Metamask wallet will pop up and ask for your approval to continue with the deployment. A second signature request will appear after you confirm that the smart contract has been successfully deployed, allowing you to add it to the thirdweb dashboard for additional management and interaction with the dashboard's features.
