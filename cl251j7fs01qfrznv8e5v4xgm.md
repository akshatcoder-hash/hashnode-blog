# Finding Beginner Friendly Open Source Projects

There's no need to overthink how you're going to contribute works on all levels. Instead, consider some of the projects you already use and how you may improve or change them.

According to research, documentation, typo repairs, and even translations account for about 30% of all casual contributions.

If you are a first-time contributor – which everybody is at some point – here are some links that will get you started in the open source world:
